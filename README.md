## Project Description

For this project I refactored code so that the HTML elements were semantic and the CSS properties were logically organizaed and consolidated. Refactoring for better semantics and organization creates code that follows accessibility standards and general best practices for web development. In order to refactor the HTML I looked for vague div elements that could've used specific semantic tags in order to make the code easier to read, for developers and screen readers. To refactor the CSS, I looked for redundant properties and values that I could combine to save lines. I also added comments to the CSS so its structure was easier to follow in relation to the HTML page structure.
